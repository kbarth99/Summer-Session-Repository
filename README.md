Text Analysis of Tips from Former Students

Hi! Welcome to my first GitHub Repository. 
In this file, you will find advice from former students at the Institute for Advanced Analytics and the analysis I conducted using my python skills prior to this intense program.
I believe this will be a great benchmark to show my growth over the next year and I hope you enjoy the insights I was able to find.

Thank you so much for stopping by!
